-Manually compile a list of categories and URLs
	-This can be done as a dictionary
-Scrape the Names and URLs of each main categories' sub category
	-Each sub categories' info can be stored as dictionaries or objects??? dunno yet

Getting the data:
-Send post request that allows upto 36 items, if less than 36 retrieved, stop increasing page number.

Getting nutritional information:
-Check that nutritional information contains the word protien
-Check for product overlap, should probably use an ID for this. Products can bein multiple categories.
-Ensure that product is not missing weight or protein value
	-Maybe check if protein value is extremely small
-Weight is stored in "Package Size". Will need to parse this for different measurements




-Database that stores the final data:
	-Product URL
	-Product Image URL
	-Product Description
	-Product Price (to be used in combination with package size to display cost)
	-Product package size (not to be used for calcuations)
	-Product "CupPrice". This is price per CupMeasure.
	-Product "CupMeasure". Arbitrary value of measure for the product.
	-Product Protein per 100g
	-Product price per gram of protein
	-Product Category
	-Product Sub category
	-Product ID?
	-Vegetarian, true or false
	-Allergens?

-Disambiguation:
	-PPGP: Price Per Gram of Protein
	-PPP: Protein Per Product
	-PPS: Protein Per Serve

Calculations that need to be made:
	-PPGP: Price Per Gram of Protein
	-PPP: Protein Per Product
	-PPS: Protein Per Serve
	-Disambiguate cupMeasure and cupPrice, make sure program knows different measurements
