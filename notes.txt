-Manually compile a list of categories and URLs
	-This can be done as a dictionary
-Scrape the Names and URLs of each main categories' sub category
	-Each sub categories' info can be stored as dictionaries or objects??? dunno yet

Getting the data:
-Send post request that allows upto 36 items, if less than 36 retrieved, stop increasing page number.

Getting nutritional information:
-Check that nutritional information contains the word protien
-Check for product overlap, should probably use an ID for this. Products can bein multiple categories.
-Ensure that product is not missing weight or protein value
	-Maybe check if protein value is extremely small
-Weight is stored in "Package Size". Will need to parse this for different measurements




-Database that stores the final data:
	-Product URL
	-Product Image URL
	-Product Description
	-Product Price (to be used in combination with package size to display cost)
	-Product PackageSize (Weight of contents, not including packaging)
	-Product "CupPrice". This is price per CupMeasure.
	-Product "CupMeasure". Arbitrary value of measure for the product.
	-Product Protein per 100g
	-Product price per gram of protein
	-Product Category
	-Product Sub category
	-Product ID?
	-Vegetarian, true or false
	-Allergens?

-Disambiguation:
	-PPGP: Price Per Gram of Protein
	-PPP: Protein Per Product
	-PPS: Protein Per Serve

Calculations that need to be made:
	-PPGP: Price Per Gram of Protein
	-PPP: Protein Per Product
	-PPS: Protein Per Serve
	-Disambiguate cupMeasure and cupPrice, make sure program knows different measurements

	-find the cost of product per 100 grams, then how much protein per 100 grams. Divide cost by protein. PPGP
	-CupMeasure seems to be in either 100g, 1kg or 1L values.
	
	-Should consider using product price and PackageSize to find price per 100g / price per 1kg
	 because they will always be present. eg if Package Size = 650, 1000 / 650 = 1.53846....
	 so multiply price by 1.53846 to find price per 1000g

	 -Proteinquantity per 100 grams is ID 878 in the nutritional information json string

	 todo:
	  -servings
	  -What if it has protein per serve but not per 100g ????
	  	-Find protein per 100g from protein per serve and serve size or ignore???
		-Need to check that protein quantity per 100g is not listed as seperate items
	  -Cut out duplicates
